		<h2>Events and Event Processing</h2>
	<p>Event is something that happens. We can think of an event as simple as taking a step 
	or as complex as making a transaction, which involves - swipe, information going to payment 
	gateway, verification involving authenticity, fraud and deducting the amount from your 
	account and updating the database tables. An event can be simply represented as an event 
	log.</p>

<p>
e1 = going to market
e2 = buying stuff
e3 = return</p>


<p>An event line can also be an abstraction, involving multiple events. The single act of 
going to market can be an abstraction over - getting ready, eating a cab and the cabby taking 
you to the desired location. Analogous to an object being made of a number of atoms,, any 
event can thought of to be composed of a number of granular/singular events, each with its 
own properties.</p>

<p>Currently, there are systems that monitor user activity over the web. This is of immense 
use to internet companies to analyse user behaviour and respond according to that if needed. 
For example, there are systems that analyse click stream data and mouse pointer location to 
identify what these is interested in. In the near future, one can expect systems that sense 
at what point in the screen/monitor user is looking at.</p>

<p>Events are generated continuously in an ecosystem. The continuous sequence of events are 
called event stream. Processing event stream of an ecosystem is a challenge for any large 
scale system. This is achieved by processing events in a distributed manner.</p>
